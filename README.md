# dotTrack
**A customizable fitness tracker** that offers a simple yet effective way to track your habits and to-dos.

Hi, I'm Luisa, the developer of dotTrack. I created this app because I wanted to focus on building better habits, improving my health, and boosting productivity. Inspired by a growing trend to make the most out of the last three months of the year and how people were struggling to track their progress, I saw the need for a customizable, all-in-one tracker.
